# Figures and Plotting Guide

* If possible, export figures in a vector format so they can be rescaled as
  needed (PDF or EPS). Otherwise, export them to the actual size required.
* Ensure all text is legible at the size at which it will be viewed.
* Use a consistent colour scheme through all figures and the project more
  generally.
