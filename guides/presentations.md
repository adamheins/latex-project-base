# Presentations

## Organization
* Number the pages (this makes it easy to refer back to particular slides)

## Appearance
* Colour scheme of black, red, and blue.
  - colours should be dark enough to be easy to read
* Ideally, figure colour schemes should match that of the presentation
* Respect margins and white space, especially when figures are involved --
  don't cram them in!
* Do not have too much text on each slide, nor text that is too small.
* Consider having content appear sequentially rather than at once, so that the
  audience can view it as it becomes relevant, rather than being overwhelmed
  and distracted immediately following a slide transition.
