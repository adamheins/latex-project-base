# Experimental Design Tips

* The set of experiments should be principled and follow a logical order. There
  should be no risk of someone wondering why a certain experiment was omitted.
* Plan a draft first, think about it, then consult with another person to
  ensure that it is sane.

## Data Collection
* Pay a lot of attention to data hygiene. Keep data organized and
  well-labeled, or you will forget which experiment it is collected from.
* Data collection and organization should be easy and as automated as possible.
  Pay attention to how it can be viewed in the short and long terms.
* Look at data after collecting, to make sure it is sane.
